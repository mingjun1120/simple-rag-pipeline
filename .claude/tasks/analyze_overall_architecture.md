# Task: Analyze Overall Architecture

## Objective
- Produce a concise but comprehensive explanation of the repository's overall architecture for the user.

## Plan
1. Inspect the repository structure to inventory core modules and supporting packages, ensuring coverage of all major layers (interfaces, implementations, utilities, entrypoints).
2. Review key orchestrator and interface files (`main.py`, `src/rag_pipeline.py`, `src/interface/*`) to understand how components interact and which abstractions are enforced.
3. Examine representative implementation modules (datastore, indexer, retriever, response generator, evaluator) to confirm responsibilities, dependencies, and data flow between them.
4. Synthesize findings into an architectural overview highlighting component roles, dependency graph, configuration, and runtime flow so the explanation aligns with what exists in code.

## Notes
- Focus on actual code relationships rather than prior documentation where they diverge.
- Capture any notable patterns (dependency injection, concurrency, configuration-driven behavior) for inclusion in the final summary.
